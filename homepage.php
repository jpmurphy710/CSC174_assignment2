				<h2>First Thing's First</h2>

				<p>Now, this is a story all about how
				My life got flipped-turned upside down
				And I'd like to take a minute
				Just sit right there
				I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel Air
				In west Philadelphia born and raised
				On the playground was where I spent most of my days
				Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool
				And all shootin some b-ball outside of the school
				When a couple of guys who were up to no good
				Started making trouble in my neighborhood
				I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
				She said 'You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air'
				I begged and pleaded with her day after day
				But she packed my suit case and sent me on my way
				She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket.
				I put my Walkman on and said, 'I might as well kick it'.
				First class, yo this is bad
				Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass.
				Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like?
				Hmm this might be alright.
				But wait I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that
				Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat?
				I don't think so
				I'll see when I get there
				I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air
				Well, the plane landed and when I came out
				There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out
				I ain't trying to get arrested yet
				I just got here
				I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared
				I whistled for a cab and when it came near
				The license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror
				If anything I could say that this cab was rare
				But I thought 'Nah, forget it' - 'Yo, homes to Bel Air'
				I pulled up to the house about seven or eigth
				And I yelled to the cabbie 'Yo homes smell ya later'
				I looked at my kingdom
				I was finally there
				To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel Air</p>
